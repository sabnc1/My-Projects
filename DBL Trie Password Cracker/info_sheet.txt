Does your program run without error?:


No

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:
Program runs out of memory. If you increase heap size it works fine

. I increased heap to 4gig and it worked



Check function works incorrectly






Additional comments to the grader:








The check function takes a long time to initialize and ask for user input. You also need to make sure to increase heap size or it'll throw an error.
